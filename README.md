It is a Python Based application which recognizes image uploaded by user based on the CIFAR-10 Dataset [The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different 
classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.] It makes use of Flask for server capabilities as to upload an image for classification.
It uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the extended version of artificial neural networks (ANN) which is predominantly used to extract the feature from the grid-like matrix dataset. For example visual datasets like 
images or videos where data patterns play an extensive role.)
